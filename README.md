# Landmark Classifier

This project involves building a machine learning model that predicts the location of a photo based on discernible landmarks in the image. The goal is to automatically classify landmarks and provide location data for photos that may not have metadata. This is useful for photo-sharing and storage services that want to offer features like automatic tagging and photo organization.

## Project Overview

The project aims to solve the problem of missing location metadata in photos by detecting and classifying landmarks in images. This model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the location of an image based on landmarks depicted in the image.

### Key Components:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing images for model input, such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **CNN Model**: Design and train a CNN to classify landmark images.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model on landmark images, evaluate performance, and fine-tune the model.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a web app for real-time predictions.
